        <h4>Our researchers are currently involved in national project 171019:</h4>
        <h1>High energy physics with CMS detector</h1>
        <div class="text1">
        
        <p>Our project covers 4 activities of which 3 are related to CMS project in CERN: (1) CMS hardware detectors, (2) data analysis collected by CMS detector, and (3) engineering activity, while activity (4) relates to biomedicine and cooperation with INFN Catania, Italy and CERN. (1) Engagement on hardware refers to improving the control of two parts of the CMS EM calorimeter: the ESS and RHS that the team has designed. ESS reconstruction and testing has been completed, new micro-controllers have been programmed and installed. In RHS, testing the measurement of moisture in the system was completed. The CMS experiment is in progress and both ESS and RHS detectors work smoothly. (2) Data analysis includes two areas: (a) particle physics; and (b) heavy-ion collision physics. (a) Studies in particle physics are managed by M. Djordjevic, who is currently at the prestigious Research Fellow position in CERN. From 2015, he is the convener of the "Cross POG and Particle Flow HLT" group and is responsible for implementing the optimal reduction of the offline algorithm Particle Flow at the HLT level event selection. He is also a shift leader who coordinates the implementation of the data collection plan and manages the team of 20 experts who continuously monitor the quality of the data received. The performance of Djordjevic has enabled him to be selected in front of the CMS Collaboration to present the results of the analyzes on which he worked and the results of other (related) CMS analyzes at several conferences of which we highlight the leading LaThuile 2015 conference, Italy. 
        <p>(b) J. Milosevic is in charge of the heavy ion collision area. His subgroup deals with the analysis of the quark-gluon plasma signal. The results of these analyzes were published in two extensive CMS work as well as in one extensive CERES work. The significance of these works is reflected in the fact that they were presented by the members of the Belgrade CMS group at a number of conferences, from which we highlight the top Quark Matter 2014 and ICHEP 2014. The first results of the new analysis they are working on have already been presented at Quark Matter 2015. The significance of these results is best illustrates that for the third consecutive year, Serbia has been holding the first place in the CMS collaboration in the number of presentations at the most important conferences, and among the 42 countries participating in the collaboration. Recently, a seminar was held on these results in Saclay in front of the auditorium made from 3 scientists of the institution: 'Saclay NRC', 'IPN Orsay' and 'Ecole Politechnique'. </p>
            <p>(3) Engineering activities are carried out by N. Smiljkovic and are related to the future upgrade of CMS detectors: platform design, reinstallation of PIXEL detectors, additional calorimeter cooling system, new accelerator tubes and installation of the new supermodule ECAL detector. </p>
           <p> (4) I. Petrović deals with biomedical activities which are referred to DNA damage after irradiation of the in vitro model. The kinetics of the formation and disappearance of the histone form in the treated samples were observed. In the frame of GEANT4 CERN Collaboration, simulations of two-way interruptions on DNA were performed as well as analysis of experimental data obtained by irradiation of human cells in culture. The results of the research have been published and presented at several international conferences. Project collaborators cooperate with more renowned international institutions. Recently, Project of Particular Relevance with INFN LNS (Italy) has been approved. </p>
